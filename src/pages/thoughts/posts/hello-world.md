## _Who knew vibe coding wasn't just a meme?_

In what I can only describe as techno-sorcery, my first experiment in agentic AI has culminated in the completion of some deeply satisfying personal programming. I now have a nook of my website to share my thoughts--_and get this_--it's rendered from the ever-portable plaintext format, markdown!

## _How did I do it?_

Today's free, infinite agentic AI combo move: VSCode + [Cline](https://cline.bot/) on [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key)'s `gemini-2.5-pro` model (thanks in part to [u/marcosvrs' comment on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLine/comments/1jx7wgq/comment/mmp0gud/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)).

Instead of paying for Cursor, I was able to kick back and let Claude + Gemini churn away and perform 80% as well. This was a marked improvement above GitHub Copilot, which I rely upon for my day job.

## So here we are!

Good morning, starshine. The Earth says, "Hello!"

Special thanks to the contributors of [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown) for doing the heavy lifting of rendering my markdown notes into stylish HTML.
