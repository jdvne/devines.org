write about making my pushpin map project

include pictures

talk about
- lack of cheap options to purchase
- choosing "where"
- projecting the image onto the corkboard
- colors
- photopea and troubles getting lines right
- 3d printed helper tools
- learning to be OK with imperfection
    - yearning for creativity without an outlet
    - "bad art"
